Welcome to the Sippy project, a prime example of BharatNXT's commitment to excellence in software development. Sippy is a mobile application built using Flutter, designed to simplify and enhance the experience of calculating and managing Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). This app not only serves as a useful tool for investors but also demonstrates the high standards of code quality and the use of sophisticated development tools and practices that are a hallmark of BharatNXT.

## About Sippy

Sippy is a user-friendly SIP calculator app that embodies BharatNXT's best practices in software development. It is designed to help users estimate the future value of their investments through systematic investment plans, showcasing our adherence to clean code, efficient design patterns, and user-centric interfaces.

## BharatNXT's Development Standards and Tools

In developing Sippy, we adhere to a set of high standards and utilize a variety of tools to ensure code quality and efficiency:

- **Code Quality**: We follow strict coding standards and conduct thorough code reviews to maintain high quality. Tools like Codacy and SonarQube are integrated for automated code quality checks.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Utilizing platforms like Bitrise and Jenkins, we ensure that every code commit goes through a rigorous process of building, testing, and deployment automation.
- **Testing**: Emphasis on writing comprehensive unit and integration tests using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito for Flutter.
- **Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation is a priority, making it easier for new developers to understand and contribute to the project.

## Built With Excellence

Sippy is crafted with a suite of top-tier development tools and practices:

- **Flutter Test**: We ensure the reliability and robustness of Sippy through comprehensive unit and widget testing, leveraging the integrated testing framework provided by Flutter.
- **Dart Analyzer & Flutter Lint**: Our code is consistently reviewed for quality and potential issues using Dart Analyzer, and we adhere to best practices with Flutter Lint to maintain a high standard of code quality.
- **Firebase Performance Monitoring**: Performance is key. We continuously monitor our app's performance in real-time, ensuring smooth and efficient user experiences.
- **Snyk**: Security is paramount. We use Snyk to regularly scan our dependencies, keeping the app secure from vulnerabilities.
- **Bitrise**: Our CI/CD pipeline, powered by Bitrise, automates our build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring consistent and reliable delivery of updates.
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: We stay on top of any issues that might occur, with detailed crash reporting from Firebase Crashlytics.
- **Postman**: Our API development and testing are streamlined using Postman, ensuring seamless integration and communication with backend services.
- **Bloc Pattern**: For scalable state management, we employ the Bloc pattern, facilitating more predictable state changes and easier debugging.
- **Flutter Intl**: Sippy is global. We use Flutter Intl for internationalization, making our app accessible to a wider audience.
- **Firebase Remote Config**: We use Firebase Remote Config for feature flagging and conducting A/B tests, allowing us to roll out features smoothly and measure their impact effectively.
