Welcome to the Sippy project, a prime example of BharatNXT's commitment to excellence in software development. Sippy is a mobile application built using Flutter, designed to simplify and enhance the experience of calculating and managing Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). This app not only serves as a useful tool for investors but also demonstrates the high standards of code quality and the use of sophisticated development tools and practices that are a hallmark of BharatNXT.

## About Sippy

Sippy is a user-friendly SIP calculator app that embodies BharatNXT's best practices in software development. It is designed to help users estimate the future value of their investments through systematic investment plans, showcasing our adherence to clean code, efficient design patterns, and user-centric interfaces.

## BharatNXT's Development Standards and Tools

In developing Sippy, we adhere to a set of high standards and utilize a variety of tools to ensure code quality and efficiency:

- **Code Quality**: We follow strict coding standards and conduct thorough code reviews to maintain high quality. Tools like Codacy and SonarQube are integrated for automated code quality checks.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Utilizing platforms like Bitrise and Jenkins, we ensure that every code commit goes through a rigorous process of building, testing, and deployment automation.
- **Testing**: Emphasis on writing comprehensive unit and integration tests using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito for Flutter.
- **Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation is a priority, making it easier for new developers to understand and contribute to the project.
